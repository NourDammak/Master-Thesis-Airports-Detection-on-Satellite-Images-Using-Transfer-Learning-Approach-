# Repository for Master Thesis: 'Airports Detection on Satellite Images Using Transfer Learning Approach'

This repository contains the source code and supporting files for my Master's thesis titled 'Airports Detection on Satellite Images Using Transfer Learning Approach.' 

The project aims to investigate the performance of various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures using Transfer Learning techniques on Sentinel-2 satellite data. The objective is to address the challenges of limited labeled data and varying image characteristics to improve model accuracy and reduce the need for extensive training data.

## Content

The repository consists of two Python Jupyter notebooks:

1. **Classic Method Notebook:** This notebook contains the implementation of the classic method of airport detection using satellite imagery. It includes the pre-processing steps, model selection, training, and evaluation.

2. **Cross-Validation Method Notebook:** This notebook contains the implementation of the cross-validation method. It includes the pre-processing steps, model selection, training, and evaluation using a cross-validation approach.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, you can install it using `pip install notebook` or `conda install -c conda-forge notebook` if you're using Anaconda.
3. Navigate to the cloned repository and open the Jupyter notebooks to view the code and corresponding explanations.
4. To run the code, ensure that you have all the necessary Python packages installed. You can install the necessary packages using pip (e.g., `pip install numpy pandas keras tensorflow matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`).
5. Before running the notebooks, please ensure that you have the correct path to the dataset. Modify the dataset paths in the notebooks as needed.

## Dependencies
